    "\n",

    " - import some data types. Here, we import `QInt` which specifies a quantum integer. This is a quantum data type *class*. When writing a quantum program, we need to instantiate these into quantum data type *objects* by providing any *compile-time classical parameters* to the data type's constructor.\n",
    " - declare a *register* for our program. We use the `add_register` method. We provide a name for the register; and we provide the quantum data type. The method returns a handle to the declared register that we can use later. These handles are called *soquets*. They will always be instantiated and consumed by the framework&mdash;the quantum programmer should never concern themselves with the internals of a Python soquet object.\n",
    " - immediately finish the program. Since this first program does nothing, we immediately return. Our call to `bb.finalize` maps output register names to soquets.  "

Although clearly one cannot achieve *quantum advantage* with only classical logic, a surprising number of *subroutines* in full quantum programs involve reversible-classical logic. In this context, the classical-reversible subroutines are called on superpositions of quantum data; but by factoring these parts into subroutines, we can write unit tests involving individual classical input/output states.\n",
