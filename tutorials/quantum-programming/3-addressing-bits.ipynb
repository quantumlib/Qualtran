    "\n",
    "Qualtran lets you write quantum programs and subroutines by composing lower-level subroutines, gates, and operations. We call these composable objects *bloqs* because they are the quantum building blocks of a complex algorithm. Composition is recursive: composing (lower-level) bloqs defines (higher-level) bloqs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will write a very simple quantum program by composing bloqs. The program will declare two input/output registers named 'x' and 'y' and swap the (quantum) integers stored within. In particular, we will swap each individual bit encoding the two integers. This tutorial will show you how `Split` and `Join` can be used to implement low-level routines."

    "Our subroutine inputs and outputs two quantum integers. Often, we try to operate on high-level data types like this to remove classes of (quantum) type errors. When writing low-level quantum subroutines, we have to peel back the details of the encoding to write decompositions that take us closer to a typical quantum gateset of one- and two-qubit gates.\n",

    "We can translate this pseudocode into a well-formed Qualtran program relatively straightforwardly. We need to take particular care when iterating over \"each bit in x, y\". What does this actually mean? In Qualtran, we assume that data is encoded in qubits, and writing low-level operations requires temporarily removing the quantum data type abstraction to operate on the bits directly. The programmer must explicitly state their intent to do so by including *bookkeeping* operations in the program. Below, we use `split` and `join` to manipulate individual bits.\n",
