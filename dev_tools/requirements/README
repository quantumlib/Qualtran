We use `uv` to manage dependencies.

 - From the project's root directory, run `uv lock` to pin the versions of all transitive
   dependencies in the uv.lock file.
 - Run `uv lock -U` to upgrade the pinned versions.
 - Run `uv sync --frozen --no-dev [--group test/typing/lint/..]` to install the pinned dependencies.
 - You can use `export-from-uv-lock.sh` in this directory to output legacy requirements.txt
   environment files.
