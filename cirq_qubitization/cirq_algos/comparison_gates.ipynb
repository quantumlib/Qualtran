    "## Abstract\n",
    "Quantum comparison gates can be split into two categories: quantum-classical when comparing a quantum number to a classical number and quantum-quantum when comparing two quantum numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison gates are important building block for quantum algorithms, yet they are always relegated to the appendicies usually with figures showing how they work on a small number of qubits. This leads to cases where researchers potentially waste time reinvents on already existing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intention of this notebook is to serve as documentary of the current state of the art for comparison gates while expalining how they work both algorithmically and programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note:** Most of the ideas explained here are built into [cirq-ft](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/cirq-ft). [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/)'s fault tolerant sublibrary."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The current optimal implementation of a reversible oracle for comparing two quantum numbers of $n$ qubits each is $8n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ and is given in the supplementary materials of [Berry et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-018-0071-5). Their implementation uses divide and conquer technique to create a binary tree of depth $\\log_2{(n)}$ whose leafs are the qubits of the numbers with intermediate values stored in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ ancillas. Each non leaf node uses two CSWAP operations and the value of the comparison is computed from the root node using one Toffoli. \n",
    "\n",
    "When this decomposition is applied to the case where one input is a list of qubits and the the other is a classical number (i.e. a string of bits) this decomposition gives a $6n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ T complexity since at the level right above the leafs half of the CSWAP operations collapse to either identity or SWAP, thus the number of CSWAPs becomes $\\approx \\frac{n}{2} + 2 \\times \\frac{n}{2} = \\frac{3n}{2}$, leadining to $4 \\times \\frac{3n}{2} = 6n$ T operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this is not the optimal way -in terms of T count- to compare a quantum number to a classical number which is $4n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ T operations. The way to do can be found in appendix H of [Berry et al., 2019](\n",
    "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1902.02134) and is based on reducing the problem to subtraction. The reduction in T count comes at the cost of linear depth as opposed to the logarithmic depth from the $6n$ decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows I explain the T optimal ways for comparison in different cases."

    "## Equality as a special case\n",
    "Before we proceed to the comparison oracle we take a look at the equality oracle actually as a special case with a T complexity of only $4n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$, as it can be implemented as a qubit-wise And operation. This qubit wise And operation itself can be done using only $4n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ as per [Babbush et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1103%2Fphysrevx.8.041015) and [Craig Gidney](https://algassert.com/post/1903).\n",

    "### Quantum-Classical Case\n",
    "In the quantum classical case all we need to do is to compute qubit/bit wise equality\n",
    "$$(q_0 = b_0) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (q_{n-1} = b_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In `cirq-ft` this is can be accomplished using the `And` gate as `And(cv=bits)` where `bits` are the bits of the classical number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum-Quantum Case\n",
    "In the quantum-quantum case the equality is still bitwise $$(q_0 = p_0) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (q_{n-1} = p_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same as the and $$(q_0 \\oplus p_0 = 0) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (q_{n-1}\\oplus p_{n-1} = 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\oplus$ is the binary xor operation. This allows us to use `cirq_ft`'s `And` on the result of the xor."

    "For the quantum-classical case we scanned the numbers sequentially from left to right to compute the comparison result, a similar strategy can be use to create a decomposition that has $12n - 8$ T complexity and linear depth. We won't go in depth into that way but refer the reader to  my incomplete [PR](https://github.com/quantumlib/Qualtran/pull/205). Instead we discuss the superior decomposition propsed by [Berry et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-018-0071-5) which has $8n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ T complexiy and logarithmic depth.\n",
