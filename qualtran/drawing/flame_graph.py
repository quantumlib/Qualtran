            for the flame graph. This is the graph we do a DFS ordering on.
        graph_t: Callgraph to use to derive T-complexity of the Bloq. Ideally, we should just be able
            to invoke the `bloq.t_complexity().t` but this hides the T-costs due to rotations, so we
            use a temporary solution to invoke `_t_counts_for_bloq(bloq, graph_t)`. The graph is not
            mutated over the course of DFS and hence can be used as a hash key for better performance.
        prefix: A string that represents the bloqs visited in the path so far. This is mutated as the
            graph is traversed and represents the current path from the root node to the current node

    For each bloq in the input, this will do a DFS ordering over all edges in the DAG and

    added for a leaf node encodes the entire path taken from the root node to the leaf node
    and is repeated a number of times that's equivalent to the weight of that path. Thus, the
    length of the output would be roughly equal to the number of T-gates in the Bloq and can be
    very high. If you want to limit the output size, consider specifying a `keep` predicate where
    the leaf nodes are higher level Bloqs with a larger T-count weight.
