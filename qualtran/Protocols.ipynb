    "We write bloqs so we can query properties, draw diagrams, and check the correctness of quantum algorithms. Basically: we write bloqs so we can do things with them! Each 'thing'--or genre of thing--we want to do has an associated \"protocol\". In our usage of the term, a protocol is a set of methods, functions, or procedures to structure a relevant piece of functionality.\n",

    " \n",
    "## Components of a protocol\n",
    "Specifically, a protocol is composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A method on `Bloq` that takes no arguments and returns a property of interest. This is the **interface**\n",
    " - A method on `Bloq` that takes system-supplied arguments which bloq authors can override to provide information for the protocol. This is the **implementation**.\n",
    " - A Python module containing functions for plumbing the implementation into the interface and other **additional functionality**.\n",
    " - Helper functions for implementing one protocol in terms of another called **fallbacks**. Some protocols have a **default fallback** that requires no special action from the bloq author."

    "## Summary of Qualtran protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a decomposition of a bloq in terms of its component bloqs by calling `bloq.decompose_bloq()`. Additional functionality is provided by the `qualtran.BloqBuilder` class. To implement this protocol, bloq authors can override `Bloq.build_composite_bloq(...)`. A fallback to use a Cirq decomposition is provided. There is no default fallback -- `qualtran.DecomposeNotImplementedError` will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a directed-acyclic graph representing the hierarchical decomposition of bloqs by calling `bloq.call_graph()` or direct callees with `bloq.bloq_counts()`. Additional functionality is contained in the `qualtran.resource_counting` module. To implement this protocol, bloq authors can override `Bloq.build_call_graph(...)`. The default fallback uses the decomposition protocol and `build_cbloq_call_graph(...)`. See the full [call graph protocol documentation](./resource_counting/bloq_counts.ipynb) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a tensor (i.e. vector or matrix representation) of a bloq or composite bloq by calling `bloq.tensor_contract()`. Additional functionality is contained in the `qualtran.simulation.tensor` module. To implement this protocol, bloq authors can override `Bloq.add_my_tensors(...)`. The default fallback uses the decomposition protocol and `cbloq_as_contracted_tensor(...)`. See the full [tensor protocol documentation](./simulation/tensor.ipynb) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a bloq's classical action on a basis state by calling `bloq.call_classically(**vals)`. Additional functionality is contained in the `qualtran.simulation.classical_sim` module. To implement this protocol, bloq authors can override `Bloq.on_classical_vals(...)`. The default fallback uses the decomposition protocol and `cbloq_call_classically`. An exception should be raised if a bloq acts non-classically on its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods on `Bloq` can be called or overridden to support drawing or interoperability with Cirq."
