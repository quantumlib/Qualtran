    "### Quimb index format\n",
    "\n",
    "In `CompositeBloq`, we form the compute graph by storing a list of nodes and edges. Quimb uses a different strategy for representing the tensor network graphs. To form a tensor network in Quimb, we provide a list of `qtn.Tensor` which contain not only the tensor data but also a list of \"indices\" that can form connections to other tensors. Similar to the Einstein summation convention, if two tensors each have an index with the same name: an edge is created in the tensor network graph and this shared index is summed over. These indices are traditionally short strings like `\"k\"`, but can be any hashable Python object. In `CompositeBloq`, the unique object that identifies a connection between bloqs is `qualtran.Connection`, so we use these connection objects as our indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualtran and Quimb both support \"wires\" with arbitrary bitsize. Qualtran uses bookkeeping bloqs like `Join` and `Split` to fuse and un-fuse indices. In theory, these operations should be free in the tensor contraction, as they are essentially an identity tensor. In our understanding, Quimb does not have special support for supporting these re-shaping operations within the tensor network graph. In versions of Qualtran prior to v0.5, split and join operations were tensored up to `n`-sized identity tensors. This would form a bottleneck in any contraction ordering. Therefore, we keep all the indices un-fused in the tensor network representation and use tuples of `(cxn, i)` for our tensor indices, where the second integer `i` indexes the individual bits in a register with `reg.dtype.num_qubits` > 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**\n",
    " - Each tensor index is a tuple `(cxn, i)`\n",
    " - The `cxn: qualtran.Connection` entry identifies the connection between soquets in a Qualtran compute graph.\n",

But typically if the full circuit is large enough to cause performance issues with flattening it is also too large to simulate numerically; so an exception to the general advice is made here.\n",
    "\n",
    "All bloqs in the flattened circuit must provide their explicit tensors. If your bloq's tensors ought to be derived from its decomposition: this is achieved by the previously mentioned flattening operation. If a bloq provides tensors through overriding `Bloq.my_tensors` _and also_ defines a decomposition, the explicit tensors will not be used (by default). This is because any bloq with a decomposition will be flattened.

In brief, the method must return one or more `qtn.Tensor`s that get added to the tensor network. The indices used to construct these **must** be of the correct form. Each tensor index is a tuple `(cxn, j)`. The connection entry comes from the `incoming` and `outgoing` arguments to the method. The `j` integer is the bit index within multi-bit registers.\n",
