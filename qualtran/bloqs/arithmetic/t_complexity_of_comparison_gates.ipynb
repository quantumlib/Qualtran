    "## Abstract\n",
    "Quantum comparison gates can be split into two categories: quantum-classical when comparing a quantum number to a classical number and quantum-quantum when comparing two quantum numbers (i.e. quantum registers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison gates are an important building block for quantum algorithms, yet they are always relegated to the appendices usually with figures showing how they work only on a small number of qubits. This leads to cases where researchers potentially waste time reinventing already existing methods.\n",
    "This notebook intends to serve as a documentary of the current state of the art for comparison gates while explaining how they work both algorithmically and programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Most of the ideas explained here are built into [qualtran](https://github.com/quantumlib/Qualtran/tree/main/qualtran)."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The current optimal implementation of a reversible oracle for comparing two quantum numbers of $n$ qubits each is $4n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ T operations. This is done by reducing the problem to subtraction which takes $4n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ (see. [Gidney, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06648)). \n",
    "\n",
    "This way while optimal in terms of T count has linear depth. The question of whether we can trade some T operations in order to reduce the depth of the circuit is interesting and turns out to have multiple answers.\n",
    "In this notebook, we consider the problem of doing a comparison at a depth logarithmic in the number of qubits $\\mathcal{O}(\\log{n})$. The current best way to do this is given in the supplementary materials of [Berry et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-018-0071-5) and leverages the divide and conquer technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "When this decomposition is applied to the case where one input is a list of qubits and the other is a classical number (i.e. a string of bits) this decomposition gives a $6n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ T complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows I will explain the current T optimal ways for comparison in all cases. Our focus on T count is because T count is the bottleneck when running quantum circuits in a fault-tolerant way using surface code (see. [Litinski et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1808.02892))\n",

    "## Equality as a special case\n",
    "Before we proceed to the comparison oracle we take a look at the equality oracle actually as a special case with a T complexity of only $4n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$, as it can be implemented as a qubit-wise And operation. This qubit-wise `And` operation itself can be done using only $4n + \\mathcal{O}(1)$ as per [Babbush et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1103%2Fphysrevx.8.041015) and [Craig Gidney](https://algassert.com/post/1903).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum-Classical Case\n",
    "In the quantum-classical case, all we need to do is to compute qubit/bit-wise equality\n",
    "$$(q_0 = b_0) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (q_{n-1} = b_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In `cirq-ft` this can be accomplished using the `And` gate as `And(cv=bits)` where `bits` are the bits of the classical number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum-Quantum Case\n",
    "In the quantum-quantum case the equality is still bitwise $$(q_0 = p_0) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (q_{n-1} = p_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same as the and $$(q_0 \\oplus p_0 = 0) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (q_{n-1}\\oplus p_{n-1} = 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\oplus$ is the binary xor operation. This allows us to use `qualtran`'s `And` on the result of the xor."
