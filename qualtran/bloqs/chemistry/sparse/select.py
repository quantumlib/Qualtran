    Implements the two applications of Fig. 13.

    Args:
        num_spin_orb: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called N.
        num_controls: The number of controls.

    Registers:
        flag_1b: a single qubit to flag whether the one-body Hamiltonian is to
            be applied or not during SELECT.
        swap_pq: a |+> state to restore the symmetries of the p and q indices.
        swap_rs: a |+> state to restore the symmetries of the r and s indices.
        swap_pqrs: a |+> state to restore the symmetries of between (pq) and (rs).
        theta: sign qubit.
        pqrs: the register to store the spatial orbital index.
        alpha: spin for (pq) indicies.
        beta: spin for (rs) indicies.
