class TrotterizedUnitary(Bloq):
    r"""Implement arbitrary trotterized unitary given any Trotter splitting of the Hamiltonian.

    Given an arbitrary splitting of the Hamiltonian into $\Gamma$ terms

    $$
        H = \sum_{\gamma=1}^\Gamma H_\gamma
    $$

    then the unitary $e^{-i t H}$ can be approximately implemented via a $p$-th order product
    formula

    $$
        S_p(t) = \prod_{v=1}^{\Upsilon}\prod_{\gamma=1}^\Gamma e^{-it a_{v,\gamma} H_{\pi_v(\gamma)}}
    $$

    where $\Upsilon$ is the number of `stages`, $a_{v, \gamma}$ are real numbers
    and $\pi_v(\gamma)$ is a permutation of the Hamiltonian term labels.

    In practice, to construct the unitary we adopt the convention from the second reference
    which expands the product above and merges neighbouring unitaries where
    possible.
    In particular, the trotterized unitary can be specified by

    $$
        S_p(t) = \prod_{k}^M e^{-it c_k H_{l_k}}
    $$

    where the coefficients $c_k$ are real numbers and $l_k$ is an integer
    indexing which term of the Hamiltonian to apply.

    For example, the second order Suzuki splitting would have indicies $(l)$ = (0, 1, 0)
    and coeffs = $(c)$ = (0.5, 1, 0.5), which would build

    $$
        e^{-i \frac{t}{2} H_0} e^{-i t H_1} e^{-i \frac{t}{2} H_0}
    $$

    Args:
        bloqs: A tuple of bloqs of length $\Gamma$ which implement the unitaries for
            each term in the Hamiltonian. Each bloq should be a frozen attrs
            dataclass, have an `angle` parameter. All bloqs should have the same signature.
        indices: A tuple of integers which specifies which bloq to apply when
            forming the unitary as a product of unitaries.
        coeffs: The coefficients $a$ which appear in the expression for the unitary.
        timestep: The timestep $t$.

    Registers:
        system: The system register to which to apply the unitary.
