    "    contain the index of the column and the data that it stores, i.e.: ((0, (1j,0)), (1, (0,1))).\n",
    "  - `uncompute`: defaults to `False`. Wether the compiled gate is $U$ or $U^\\dagger$. If true, the\n",
    "    data in `gate_cols`: determines the rows of the matrix, and the vectors will be transposed. That\n",
    "    is, if one wants to implement $U^\\dagger$ the `gate_cols` provided must be the same as in the\n",
    "    case of $U$. This can also be used if one wants to specify the rows of $U$ instead of the\n",
    "    columns. In this case take the conjugate of the coefficients.\n",
    "  - `internal_phase_grad`: if True, an internal phase gradient is used. Otherwise the user must\n",
    "    provide one when calling the bloq. It adds the cost of generating this state to the overall cost\n",
    "    of the Bloq, thus it should be set to True only when a single gate is to be produced or if Tcost\n",
