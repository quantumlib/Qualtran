"""Basic quantum gates.

The bloqs in this module encode gates you'd expect to find in any quantum computing
framework. It includes single-qubit unitary gates like rotations, bit- and phase-flip;
basic multi-qubit unitary gates; states and effects in the Pauli basis; and non-Clifford
gates `TGate` and `Toffoli` which are commonly counted to estimate algorithm resource
requirements.
