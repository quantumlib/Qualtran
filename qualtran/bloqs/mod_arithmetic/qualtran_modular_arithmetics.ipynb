    "### Modular Negatition\n",
    "The strucutre of the construction of this operation consists of two operations that cost $n$ toffolis between two n-bit toffolis resulting in $3n$ toffolis. The authors of [How to compute a 256-bit elliptic curve private key with only 50 million Toffoli gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08585) suggests using measurement based uncomputation (see. [Halving the cost of quantum addition](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-06-18-74/#)) to turn the last n-bit toffoli into measurements + cliffords thus reducing the cost to $2n$. However, measurement based uncomputation doesn't strictly apply here since the control register is modified between the initial `And` computation and its adjoint/uncomputation, this leads to a mismatch between the value in the register and the value in the hidden ancillas with the overall effect being the introduction of random phase flips. That is the final state will have some coefficients multiplied by $-1$ randomly. We chose not to introduce this effect into our construction.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Modular Inversion\n",
    "Our cost for this operation $26n^2+9n-1$ which differs from their cost of $26n^2+2n$ by $7n-1$. The reason of this, is the constants that they omitted for the other operations. This operation consists of a loop that repeats the same circuit $2n$ times, thus the constants of that inner circuit contribute to the coefficient of $n$ since they get multiplied by $2n$. This bloq shows Qualtran's ability to compute accurate resource estimates."

    "## Correctness checks for constructions\n",
    "Qualtran provides a suite of tools to check the correctness of bloq construction/decomposition. Out of them, we highlight the classical simulation check. This check is very important to arithmetic bloqs since it ensure that if the input is a single classical state then final state is the expected single classical state with one of the limitations of this test being that it can't detect problems with phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with this limitation the classical simulation check was able to detect problems with constructions from the literature. For the example, the use of measurement based uncomputation to lower the cost of modular negation in [How to compute a 256-bit elliptic curve private key\n",
    "with only 50 million Toffoli gates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08585) where it is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second test is checking the matrix of the construction which we calculate using tensor network contraction. Since all modular arithmetic function are reversible functions, their matrices are permutation matrices. More preciesly the submatrix for the valid input range (e.g. $[0, \\mod) × [0, \\mod)$ for modular negation) should be a permutation matrix."
