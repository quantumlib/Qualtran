    r"""Degree of the Jacobi-Anger expansion of $e^{it\sin(\theta)}$ or $e^{it\cos(\theta)}$.

    The Jacobi-Anger expansions are given by:

    $$
        C(e^{i\theta}) = e^{it\cos\theta} = \sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty i^n J_n(t) e^{in\theta}
        S(e^{i\theta}) = e^{it\sin\theta} = \sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty J_n(t) e^{in\theta}
    $$
    where $J_n$ is the $n$-th Bessel function of the first kind.

    We truncate the above series to the range $n \in [-d, d]$ such that $|J_{d+1}(t)| \le \epsilon$.

    If any parameter is symbolic, this returns an asymptotic result given by
    $$
        d = \mathcal{O}(t + \frac{\log\epsilon}{\log\log\epsilon})
    $$

    Args:
        t: scale of the exponent in the function to approximate.
        precision: $\epsilon$ in the above polynomial approximation

    Returns:
        Truncation degree $d$ as defined above.
