    "# Qubit Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of qubits is an important cost for running a quantum algorithm. The provided `QubitCounts()` cost key can efficiently estimate the qubit count of even large-scale algorithms by exploiting the hierarchical structure of bloq decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of qubits is bounded from below by the number of qubits implied by the signature.\n",
    "If a bloq has no callees, the size implied by the signature will be returned. Otherwise,\n",
    "`QubitCounts()` will try to compute the number of qubits by inspecting the decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the decomposition, each (sub)bloq is considered to be executed sequentially. The \"width\"\n",
    "of the circuit (i.e. the number of qubits) at each sequence point is the number of qubits\n",
    "required by the subbloq (computed recursively) plus any \"bystander\" idling wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an estimate for the number of qubits required by an algorithm. Specifically:\n",
    " - Bloqs are assumed to be executed sequentially, minimizing the number of qubits potentially\n",
    "   at the expense of greater circuit depth or execution time.\n",
    " - We do not consider \"tetris-ing\" subbloqs. In a decomposition, each subbloq is assumed\n",
    "   to be using all of its qubits for the duration of its execution. This could potentially\n",
    "   overestimate the total number of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Min-Max style estimate can provide a good balance between accuracy and scalability\n",
    "of the accounting. To fully account for each qubit and manage space-vs-time trade-offs,\n",
    "you must comprehensively decompose your algorithm to a `cirq.Circuit` of basic gates and\n",
    "use a `cirq.QubitManager` to manage trade-offs. This may be computationally expensive for\n",
    "large algorithms."
