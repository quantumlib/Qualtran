    The number of algorithm qubits is reported by Qualtran as a logical cost of a bloq. The
    surface code is a rate-1 code, so each bit of data needs at least one surface code tile. Due
    to locality constraints imposed by the 2D surface code combined with the need to interact
    qubits that aren’t necessarily local, additional tiles are needed to actually execute a program.

    Each data block is responsible for reporting the number of tiles required to store a certain
    number of algorithm qubits; as well as the number of time steps required to consume a magic
    state. Different data blocks exist in the literature, and data block provides a different
    space-time tradeoff.

    The space occupied by the data block is to be contrasted with the space used for magic
    state distillation.
